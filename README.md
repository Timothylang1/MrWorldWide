# MrWorldWide
Python game that tests your knowledge of the capitals of the world.

Welcome to Mr. WorldWide! To run the game, run the file titled FINALCODE.py. This game will test how well you know the capitals of the world! There are a total of six levels, one for each continent (excluding Antartica) that get increasingly difficult. To advance to the next level, you must correctly identify a third or more of the capitals in the continent. If you successfully do so, you advance to the next level! Otherwise, the game restarts.

Good luck and have fun!

Created by Timothy Lang, Alex McCreight, and Kaleb Gezahegn for Macalester COMP-123 class final project.
